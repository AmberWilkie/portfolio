The core idea of _Getting Things Done_ is removing from your mind everything that can be removed from your mind,
leaving it open to think creatively, experience flow, and concentrate on what is in front of you. GTD details (excruciatingly details)
how to set up a system for extracting obligations from your head. When you trust that your system will remind you of everything you need to do,
you can experience "mind like water", David Allen promises.

While the book emphasizes that personal and professional obligations must all be recorded in your system,
I'm going to focus on work and specifically the work of a programmer. How can developers use Getting Things Done to improve
their focus and enjoyment at work? If you find it's helpful at work, perhaps you'll expand to include personal obligations as well.

This article is an interpretation and distillation of an entire book, aimed at a specific group of people.
If you find it helpful, you should go ahead and read the book itself! In the meantime, how to implement GTD, for programmers.

# Step One: The Dump ("Capture")
The first part of implementing a GTD system is to get everything in your head out of it.
To do this, you will require an Inbox - probably both a physical one (for papers and objects) and a digital one. Your email account
certainly qualifies, but you may want to have a separate area for staging.

Now you need to empty your head of everything you are keeping track of. All those thoughts that pop up
all day long - technologies to experiment with, ex-colleagues to DM, notes for the next retro. This takes time and energy,
but it's enough to start with a regular notebook or digital list and just go to town, then allow your brain's automatic "oh hey, this thing too"
to round out the list. Put literally everything that is on your mind in this inbox. You'll be sorting through it all in the next step,
so trust that if you put it in the inbox, it will be dealt with.

If you do this step well, you probably feel a bit better already. We carry so much around in our brains, worried that if we don't
review the obligations we have, we'll drop some balls. That takes up far too much energy - and is something we can outsource to our system.

# Step Two: Process ("Clarify")
Now that everything you have been thinking about and all your obligations are somewhere in your inbox(es), you need to process
these items and sort them. There are three types of items in your inbox: actionable and non-actionable.

## Nonactionable Items
Some of the things in your inbox won't have anything that needs to be done. They could be documentation for a project,
receipts from lunch with a client, or a nice reference letter from a former employer.
Nonactionable items fall into three categories:

1. Trash. If it's trash, just throw it out now, and stop letting it take up mental energy.
2. Reference material. If no action is needed on this item now, it may belong as reference material. It should be filed somewhere logical,
either digitally or physically.
3. "Someday" material. It's time for the first list! When you come across an item that you might like to take action on,
but have no specific plans to do so at the moment, it should go on the "someday/maybe" list. Put things like "learn Go",
"refactor the email worker", and "write a talk to give at a React meetup" on this list, if you aren't planning to do them
any time soon. You probably already have a list for some things like this and you might call it an "icebox".
Your team may have one, and some of these items should go there, but you probably need a personal one too, if the whole team isn't excited about learning Go.

### Lists and Tools
There's no way to avoid this: you are going to need to create a lot of lists if you are going to implement GTD.
Your team may use Pivotal Tracker, Jira, Trello or any other number of Scrum planning tools.
Those are great, but you'll also need a personal set of lists for keeping track of your own work.
If you're implementing GTD across your entire life, I'm going to make a potentially strange recommendation:
[Google Keep](http://keep.google.com). My reason for this choice is ease of use (dead simple to add lists, items, and check things off),
and the ubiquity of this product - in your email, widget on your phone, in the browser. I always have my keep
tab open on my computer and just dump ideas into there all day.

## Actionable Items
Anything in your inbox that needs something done with it must be sorted into a list where it will receive attention.
Only once this is done will you be able to trust your system and allow your brain to stop reminding you of things.
Items with actions will fall into one of three categories:

### Projects
Items that need more than one action, and can be completed within a year should go on a **Project List**. You never actually complete
anything on the Project List; instead you keep doing Next Actions for items relating to Projects, until that Project
is resolved. You will have many more "projects" than seems reasonable, for something like "find new video conferencing system" or 
"upgrade to React v16". These seem like individual actions, but they might require you to research, get management approval, obtain budget information,
etc. If more than one step is required, it is a project.

### Calendar
Some actions need to be taken at a specific time or day. These actions should be added to your calendar.
If you need to renew your SSL license on Jan. 20 every year, set a reminder for Jan. 19 now. If your brain trusts that you will
review your calendar, you can stop worrying about the license running out.

### Next Actions
The most immediately important category is that of **Next Actions**. This list keeps track of all the steps you can take
*right now* to move your projects along. For each of your projects, you need to identify the *next action needed*.

For instance, if you need to find a new videoconferencing tool, a first action might be "research three video conferencing systems",
or you might prefer to start with "ask Janine for budget for videoconferencing". "Find new videoconferencing tool" is not a next action -
it requires too much overhead. If you need a budget before you can ask for approval, that will hold you back from making progress. Getting clarity
about the immediate next steps required allows you to zoom down your Next Actions list without getting caught up in thinking about
what steps are necessary. You can think about the next steps for each of your projects all together, batching planning in order to free up mental capacity
when you are ready to take action.

#### The two-minute rule
One of David Allen's most famous pieces of advice is to complete any task that will take less than two minutes to do,
*before it goes on your Next Actions list*. In our videoconferencing example, if we need to get the budget from Janine first,
we might fire off an email to her as we are sorting through our inbox. The item never goes on the Next Action list, but instead 
we need to add it to a...

### Waiting For
The last category is made up of items you want to do more with, but are waiting on someone else. Unfortunately,
not everyone is as organized as you are, and you'll need to keep track of all the things out there in the world relying on someone else to complete.
Keep a list of what you expect back, as well as the date you made the request. It's much easier to follow up 
with someone when you can say "I requested this two weeks ago" rather than "It's been a while".
