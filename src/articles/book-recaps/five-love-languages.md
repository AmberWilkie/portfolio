I read this book before I got serious about doing summaries. So here's a mega-quick recap:

## What are the five love languages?
### Words of affirmation
This is when you say nice things to your partner. The kind of stuff they like hearing, that boosts their self-esteem.

### Acts of service
Doing stuff for your partner, out of love, not obligation.

blah blah blah
```html
            <div key={article.id}>
              <Link to={article.fields.slug}>
                <h2>{article.frontmatter.title}</h2>
              </Link>
              <strong>{article.frontmatter.date}</strong>
              <p>{article.excerpt}</p>
            </div>
```
