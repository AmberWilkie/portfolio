A primitive data type is the most basic data type available in a given language. The available primitive types vary depending on which language you are working with - I'll discuss Javascript and Ruby. In all cases, a primitive data type refers to a built-in type within a language, and one which does not require other types to function.

# Examples
Most programming languages have an `Int` or `Integer` data type. They can be added, subtracted, and you can represent whole numbers with them.


Another extremely common type is `String` - you can store characters in them. But because of how computers store information, they may be primitive types or not, depending on the language you're using (more on that below).

# How computers store information
To understand the nature of a primitive data type, it's helpful to back up and look at how computers store information. As you probably know, computers store everything as 1s and 0s. These are grouped 8 together into a byte
