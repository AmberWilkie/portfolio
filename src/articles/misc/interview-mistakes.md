title: "Two weeks moonlighting as the tech hiring director: what I learned"

I started a new job April 1 this year. But by the end of the month, my plans had changed dramatically.
My husband had been offered a job at a lab affiliated with Princeton University. When Princeton comes calling,
you don't say no, even it means you have to leave the most awesome city in the world, and your new work. I didn't want to leave
my new company totally at a loss, so I offered to help find candidates to replace me. And then my boss, the only other person on the tech team,
immediately went on several weeks of paternity leave. Now I was the hiring manager!

It was fascinating to get a glimpse into the "other side" of the table, particularly while I was *simultaneously* job hunting
in our new home, Philadelphia. Many of the things candidates did made me want to shake them. And I also got a new perspective
on how difficult it is to both find people to interview and judge them once they are in front of you.

Here's what I learned, and advice for how to come off better in your own interviews.

# Recruitment tools are the pits
When my company brought me into the hiring fold, I got access to [AngelList](http://www.angel.co), LinkedIn
and [HoneyPot](http://www.honeypot.io) recruiter tools. They are all glorified search tools. You put in the location, skills, sometimes desired salary,
and the system spits out a list of candidates. It's up to you, the "recruiter", to contact them and make shit happen.
Unfortunately for candidates, there is just no incentive for me, the recruiter, to pay much attention to whether or not candidates are the right fit.
If I get a list of twenty people, I need to write them all and see what sticks. The candidate still has to do all the work. I have things to build as well!

My biggest grief was with LinkedIn, where I couldn't even tell if the people in the list were "open" to being contacted by recruiters or not 
(some of you may have flipped that switch). I just wrote everybody, surely pissing off a bunch of people that are tired of being pestered for jobs.

Perhaps even worse, I was conducting my own job search at the same time. But the LinkedIn trial is the same for recruiter vs. pro job hunter or whatever the person tier is.
I could see who had looked at my profile - everyone who had - and guess what? I was getting lots of contacts from recruiters
who had not done that. Just like I was not visiting the profiles of candidates I was contacting. I guess we're all too lazy, even if it's our full-time job...

# People are terrible at selling themselves
I actually had one person specifically point out to me that she did not meet the requirements listed in the job description.
That's not the kind of thing you want to draw someone's attention to, and also, *I already know that*. I had specifically reached
out to this person via a recruiting tool. 

__Never draw the interviewer's attention to your weaknesses.__ It is the job of the interviewer to tease out the challenges of bringing you on;
they will undoutedly find something wrong with you - no need to point out your flaws.

__Speak with confidence__. Too many of the candidates I interviewed were openly self-deprecating, drawing attention to things
they did poorly or skills they lacked, when we were supposed to be talking about their strengths or projects they were proud of.
Even if you don't feel confident, pretend! Practice talking about your work in a way that makes you look good.

__Have a narrative__. Be able to tell a coherent, interesting story about your career trajectory. One person organizes a team consisting of
back-end developers and designers. But he framed it as a "collaboration". I had to tease it out of him: "So, you manage a team?"



# Nobody takes notes
The first pattern I noticed amongst candidates is that nobody brings a notepad. How do they expect to remember anything we've talked about,
keep track of questions they want to ask, and even appear to be someone who cares about the answer, without writing things down?
To his credit, I believe the person I interviewed over Skype was taking notes. Everyone I met in person was emptyhanded.

# Resumes / CVs
- Uploading / emailing a docx. Who can open that shiz?
