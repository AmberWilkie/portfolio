title: "Two weeks moonlighting as the tech hiring director: what I learned"

I started a new job April 1 this year. But by the end of the month, my plans had changed dramatically.
My husband had been offered a job at a lab affiliated with Princeton University. When Princeton comes calling,
you don't say no, even it means you have to leave the most awesome city in the world, and your new work. I didn't want to leave
my new company totally at a loss, so I offered to help find candidates to replace me. 
And then my boss, the only other person on the tech team, immediately went on several weeks of paternity leave. 
Now I was the hiring manager!

It was fascinating to get a glimpse into the "other side" of the table, particularly while I was *simultaneously* job hunting
in our new home, Philadelphia. Many of the things candidates did made me want to shake them. And I also got a new perspective
on how difficult it is to both find people to interview and judge them once they are in front of you.

Here's what I learned, and advice for how to come off better in your own interviews.

# Recruitment tools are the pits
When my company brought me into the hiring fold, I got access to [AngelList](http://www.angel.co), LinkedIn
and [HoneyPot](http://www.honeypot.io) recruiter tools. They are all glorified searches. You put in the location, skills, sometimes desired salary,
and the system spits out a list of candidates. It's up to you, the "recruiter", to contact them and make shit happen.
Unfortunately for candidates, there is just no incentive for me, the recruiter, to pay much attention to whether or not candidates are the right fit.
If I get a list of twenty people, I need to write them all and see what sticks. The candidate still has to do all the work. I have things to build as well!

My biggest grief was with LinkedIn, where I couldn't even tell if the people in the list were "open" to being contacted by recruiters or not 
(some of you may have flipped that switch). I just wrote everybody, surely pissing off a bunch of people that are tired of being pestered for jobs.

Perhaps even worse, I was conducting my own job search at the same time. But the LinkedIn trial is the same for recruiter vs. pro job hunter.
I could see who had looked at my profile - everyone who had - and guess what? I was getting lots of contacts from recruiters
who had not visited my profile. Just like I was not visiting the profiles of candidates I was contacting. I guess we're all too lazy, even if it's our full-time job...

# People struggle to present a cohesive narrative about themselves
Like it or not, we are all salesmen and we all have a brand. The overwhelming majority of people I reviewed while a "recruiter" had the brand:
```markdown
MEH
```
The way they presented themselves online - from their profile photo down to the way they listed their tech stack - was
just a resounding "who cares". And worse, when we spoke in person, they just didn't have much to say about their work
or the work they'd like to do.

It is our job, in interviews, to *sell ourselves*. That means you need to get the person to *buy*. None of this requires
lying, or exaggeration, but it does require being able to get the other person jazzed about you. Here's a simple outline
of a "shpiel" you might prepare for the question "tell me a little about yourself":
- Motivation for becoming a programmer
- Early career highlights / educational details
- Current role, including tech stack
- Desires for next role

This should all fit into two minutes or less. Practice telling this to someone! Your story should roll right off your tongue,
and you should be able to tell it in such a way that it is *interesting* to the person interviewing you. I promise
your interviews will become less awkward if you can do this. As the interviewer, I can tell you it is really frustrating
to have to drag everything out of you.

# Confidence comes across as competence, and vice versa
Whether or not you are any good at your job, if you can speak coherently about what you do, you look like a great programmer.
The opposite holds true as well - if you have trouble articulating your work, you look like you have no idea what you're doing.

For instance, one front-end developer I spoke with organizes a team consisting of back-end developers and designers. 
But he framed it as a "collaboration". I had to tease it out of him: "So, you manage a team?" Eventually he begrudgingly
agreed that he "sometimes" serves as the coordinator of their projects. This should have been loud and clear: "I have
significant experience managing projects and directing teams. Here's an example."

Additionally, there is *absolutely no reason* for you to be bringing up your weaknesses unless explicitly asked, 
or the role is inappropriate for you. I actually had one person specifically point out to me that she did not meet the
 requirements listed in the job description. That's not the kind of thing you want to draw someone's attention to, and also,
  *I already know that*. I had personally reached out to this person via a recruiting tool.
  
However, if you are in the interview and it turns out the role is back-end heavy and you don't *want* to work on the back-end,
then it is perfectly acceptable to say "I prefer not to work with that kind of technology". If instead you just don't feel
*comfortable* working with back-end technologies, you keep that to yourself! If you already understand 100% of what is needed
for this new role, it is almost certainly not going to be challenging enough for you.

# "Do you have a salary range in mind?"
I have always hated this question when it comes up - often by HR in a screening call. You don't want to say a number,
because you suspect that you'll say 100 when they have 130 to spend. But in interviewing candidates for this position,
we have a somewhat limited budget. It's in line with the market, but it's tight because budgets are limited in such a small company.
Being on the "we need to save money" side of things makes this question seem very different. If you want much more money
than we are able to spend, it's best for everyone if we part ways now.

I don't have a good piece of advice here. It seems like you should be able to flip it and say "what is your budget for this position?"
but I've not seen anyone advise asking that, and I don't know that it would be well received much of anywhere. It's worth a shot, though!

I still would recommend *not* giving a number. I heard some very uncomfortable answers to this question, like
"the money isn't so important to me" or "salary isn't a priority". That's... just not how you answer this question, unless
you want to be low-balled.

If you can't possibly keep your mouth shut when they ask this question, look up what [the average is](http://www.glassdoor.com)
for your tech, experience and region. Decide how much above / below you want to be from average. **Never tell a prospective employer
what you make now**, unless it is well above average for your area. Moving roles should mean a big bump - that's why we shift around, right?

# Other patterns
- **Nobody takes notes**. How do they expect to remember anything we've talked about,
keep track of questions they want to ask, and even appear to be someone who cares about the answer, without writing things
 down? Only one of the half-dozen people we spoke to for this role even *brought* a notepad. I know not everyone is a
  note-taker, but I also know that the best developers *are*.

# Resumes / CVs
I saw lots of CVs during this process - many more than candidates we eventually interviewed. Here are some major problems
I encounted over and over:
- **Uploading / emailing anything other than a PDF.** I have to convert things like docx files, and when I do, 
they're often missing fonts and they print *terribly*. Don't make the hiring manager / recruiter / developer do unnecessary work.
 Export your files as a standard-sized PDF. You may think everything is digital nowadays but when you are reviewing 50 candidates,
 you want to print things out, organize and take notes. If I can't print your resume, that is really bad for you.
- **Including a bunch of graphics that can't print properly.** We were hiring for a partial front-end role, so that means
we had a number of people with significant design skills. Their CVs were really cool-looking, with lots of interesting
layouts and graphics. But those things couldn't print for shit. If you send me a weird-looking CV, you need the skills
to make sure it will print without all those graphics and such. If you must, send me two - one to look nice and one to print.
Even better, just make your CV without a bunch of crazy pictures and a giant file size.
