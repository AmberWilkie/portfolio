For many years, I did a recap with photos and all sorts of nostalgia. This year, obviously, there's a lot less to say. But it's always fun to revisit my reads from the previous year. In chronological ascending order of what I read, my 2020 in books:

- _How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia_, Mohsin Hamid  
    I think I watched this movie on an airplane, back when people traveled in airplanes. Honestly, I'm just really tired of hearing about rich people. They're not as interesting as people with real problems.
- _Flat Broke with Two Goats_, Jennifer McGaha
- _The Silver Linings Playbook_, Matthew Quick
- _Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies About Who You Are so You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be_, Rachel Hollis  
    This book was so much trash. Popular self-help books generally come in two shades: actual useful ways to rethink your own thinking, and a bunch of pappy nonsense. This was the latter.
- _Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup_, John Carryeyrou  
    Everyone in the tech sphere should read a book like this one. VC is totally insane and the industry is both poisoned and corrupted by the dream of fast money. Grow at all costs has never been a sustainable model, all the way up to planet-level.
- _Big Little Lies_, Liane Moriarty
- _Outbreak! Plagues That Changed History_, Bryn Barnard
- _Long Bright River_, Liz Moore
- _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_, J.K. Rowling  
    I read this book right after I graduated high school and I remember thinking the writing was really juvenile. But this year I thought maybe I should finally read the series - everyone loves them. And surely back then I was just being judgy because I'd just been in AP English. Nope, there is almost nothing to like about this book. And after asking around with colleagues who enjoyed the series, they all said the writing and plot and characters never get better... but for some reason they still like it. One colleague explained that she loved Harry Potter because she liked the idea of Hogwarts existing. I don't know what the entire rest of the world is on about.
- _So You Want to Talk About Race_, Ijeoma Oluo
- _36 Righteous Men_, Steven Pressfield
- _Becoming_, Michelle Obama  
    I guess this is the first book I read in 2020 that I really liked. This was a fascinating look into Obama's white house years. I found it fascinating how Michelle Obama wasn't 100% on board with all the politics.
- _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_, J.K. Rowling  
    Honestly, I didn't remember that I read a second one! Maybe this is when I asked my colleagues if things were going to improve. Oh well.
- _Hell in the Heartland: Murder, Meth, and the Case of Two Missing Girls_, Jax Miller
- _The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win_, Gene Kim  
    Pretty sure this should be required reading for anyone in tech. This is the story of a tech manager trying to get all the various engineering departments together to solve major business problems. Meanwhile, non-technical people are hounding him left and right. Then he basically invents Agile. For anyone not in tech, run away from this book that will surely be incredibly boring.
- _Educated_, Tara Westover
- _Wild Game: My Mother, Her Lover, and Me_, Adrienne Brodeur
- _An American Marriage_, Tayari Jones
- _Outlander_, Diana Gabaldon  
    I think I was confusing this series with Highlander. I expected much more of a sci-fi element. While I was waiting for that, the book transformed into a bust-ripping borderline pornographic romance. Works for me!
- _In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex_, Nathaniel Philbrick  
    A fascinating look into whaling; I really enjoyed this book.
- _Craftfulness: Mend Yourself by Making Things_, Rosemary Davidson
- _The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming_, David Wallace-Wells  
    You and everyone needs to read this book and then we need to demand massive action from our politicians and business leaders. This guy rips all the gloves off and lays out what is actually going to happen to the Earth in the next few decades and beyond. It's horrifying.
- _Remembering Kensington & Fishtown: Philadelphia's Riverward Neighborhoods_, Kenneth W. Milano
- _Cold: Adventures in the World's Frozen Places_, Bill Streever  
    This was a great book in the difficult-to-describe genre of nonfiction factoids told through the narrator's hero's journey.
- _Recursion_, Blake Crouch  
    Loved this one. Sci-fi, can't tell you much without ruining it, but pay attention or you'll be left in the dust.
- _Daisy Jones & The Six_, Taylor Jenkins Reid
- _Such a Fun Age_, Kiley Reid
- _The Hate U Give_, Angie Thomas
- _Desert Places_, Blake Crouch  
    I started reading the rest of Crouch's catalog after _Recursion_, but so far my first dip in is superior.
- _Locked Doors_, Blake Crouch
- _Keep Going: 10 Ways to Stay Creative in Good Times and Bad_, Austin Kleon  
    From the _Wreck This Journal_ guy, this book is helpful in a year like 2020.
- _Grown Ups: A Novel_, Emma Jane Unsworth  
    Incredibly unlikably characters, but somehow a compelling narrative.

I'm currently reading _The Outlaw Ocean: Journeys Across the Last Untamed Frontier_ by Ian Urbina. And I read a couple cookbooks and tech books that don't show up in Goodreads:
- _Javascript: The Good Parts_, Douglas Crockford
- _Zahav: A World of Israeli Cooking_, Michael Solomonov
- _Plenty_, Yotam Ottolenghi  
    These two Israeli cookbooks inspired a massive mezze feast George and I cooked for our little selves on Christmas. Left to my own devices, I'd probably eat only Lebanese food for the rest of my life.

### Some more ramblings
New Year's always makes me nostalgic - what has been, would could have been, what could be coming. This year, I know Jan. 1 is going to feel very much like the day before. But the vaccine is slowly rolling out, eventually we will be released back into the wild - to restaurants, to travel, to working in offices. I hope we, collectively, as a global society, will be able to grow from this experience. I hope that I personally will as well.

Happy New Year to any and all readers! This time next year we'll be in a much better place.
